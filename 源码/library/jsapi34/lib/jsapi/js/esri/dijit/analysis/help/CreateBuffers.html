    <p>A buffer is an area that covers a given distance from a point, line, or area feature. Buffers are typically used to create areas that can be further analyzed using a tool such as Overlay Layers. For example, if the question is &quot;What buildings are within one mile of the school?&quot;, the answer can be found by creating a one-mile buffer around the school and overlaying the buffer with the layer containing building footprints.  The end result is a layer of  those buildings within one mile of the school.

        <div>
            <p>You can enter a single distance value or multiple values, separating each value with a space.  You can also specify an attribute on the input layer that contains the distance value by clicking the Attribute button.

 When using multiple distances, you can choose how to represent the distance from the last buffer distance.   For example, if your distances are 10, 14:
                <ul>
                    <li>Choosing Rings results in buffers that go from 0 to 10 and 10 to 14.
                    </li>
                    <li>Choosing Disks results in buffers that go from 0 to 10 and 0 to 14.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                
            </p>

            <p>When buffering line features, you can choose which side of the line to buffer.  Typically, you choose both sides.  Left and right are determined as if you were walking from the first x,y coordinate of the line (the start coordinate) to the last x,y coordinate of the line (the end coordinate).  Choosing left or right usually means you know that your line features were created and stored in a particular direction (for example, upstream or downstream in a river network).   At the ends of lines the buffer can be rounded (Round) or be straight across (Flat).

            <p>This is the name of the layer that will be created in your contents and added to your map.  The default  name is based on the analysis type and the input layer name. If the layer already exists you will be asked to confirm if you want to overwrite it.
