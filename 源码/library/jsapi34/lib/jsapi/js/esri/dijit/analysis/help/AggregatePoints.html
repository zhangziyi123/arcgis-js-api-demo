    <p>This tool works with a layer of
point features (the analysis layer) and a layer of area features. It first
figures out which points fall within each area. After determining
this point-in-area spatial relationship, statistics about all
points in the area are calculated and assigned to the area. The
most basic statistic is the count of the number of points within
the area, but you can get other statistics as well. 
    </p>
    <p>For example:
        <ul>
            <li>If
your points represented coffee shops and each point has a

                <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> attribute, you can get statistics like the sum of all
                <i>TOTAL_SALES</i> within the area, or the minimum or maximum
                <i>TOTAL_SALES</i>
value, or the standard deviation of all sales within the
area.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <p>Select an area layer from your web map to which your points
will be aggregated. If there are no boundary layers in your web map, you can
select from the list of boundary layers available to
you in ArcGIS Online. Any points that fall within the boundaries of
this layer will be counted and optionally summarized using your choices of
statistics.

            <p>You can calculate statistics about attributes of the input point layer such as sum, mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation. The result layer will
contain a new attribute for each statistic calculated. Any number of statistics can be added by choosing an attribute and statistic (a new drop-down box will appear).

        <div>
            <p>You can create statistical groups using an attribute in the analysis layer.    For example, if you are aggregating crimes to neighborhood boundaries, you may have an attribute 
                <b>Crime_type</b> with five different crime types.  Each unique crime type forms a group, and the statistics you choose will be calculated for each unique value of
                <b>Crime_type</b>.  When you choose a grouping attribute, two results are created: the result layer and a related table containing the statistics.

                The result layer name will be generated by default with the name being based on the analysis type and the layer name of the input features. To change the result layer name, click inside the dialog box to edit.
            </p>
            <p>This is the name of the layer that will be created in your contents and added to your map.  The default  name is based on the analysis type and the input layer name. If the layer already exists you will be asked to confirm if you want to overwrite it.
