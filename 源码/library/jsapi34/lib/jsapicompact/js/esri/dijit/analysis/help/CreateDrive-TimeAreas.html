    <p>Create Drive-Time Areas shows what areas can be reached within a specified drive time or drive distance. It measures out from one or more points, along roads, to create a layer  that can help you answer questions such as:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Where can I go from here within a 30-minute drive?
            </li>
            <li>Where can I go from here within a 30-minute drive at 6:00 p.m. during rush hour?
            </li>
            <li>What areas of town can the fire department reach within five minutes? How would fire-response coverage improve by building a new fire station here?
            </li>
            <li>What market areas does my business cover? What areas are within 10 miles of my stores?
            </li>
        </ul>

                        <b>Driving Time</b>&mdash;The output areas show how far you can drive within the drive time you specify. The tool calculates the areas assuming average speeds along streets or, if you specify a start time, the estimated speeds given traffic conditions for that time and day.
                    </li>
                    <li>

            </p>
            <p>If you choose to use traffic in the analysis, the tool will automatically read the most accurate information available: historical, live, or predictive traffic. Historical traffic stores a record of average travel speeds at different times of the day for each day of a typical week. Live traffic uses near-current travel speeds obtained from sensors in cars and on roads. Predictive traffic uses a mix of live traffic, historical traffic, and other information to make forecasts of travel speeds.
            </p>
            <p>Not all regions support historical, live, and predictive traffic.

            <p>The time to depart from the input point locations. 
            </p>
            <p>Given a constant drive time, the size of a drive-time area can change substantially depending on the departure time and, consequently, traffic. The area tends to be smaller during peak traffic hours and larger in the middle of the night when fewer cars are on the roads.
            </p>
            <p>When calculating drive-time areas, the tool accounts for how traffic and travel speeds change throughout the drive. For example,  if you specify a 30-minute drive-time area with a departure time of 8:00 a.m., the travel speeds at the beginning of the trip (that is, near the point of departure) are calculated from 8 o'clock traffic. But as the trip continues and time elapses, traffic for different times of day are referenced. By the end of the 30-minute drive time, near the boundary of the drive-time area, the tool is referencing 8:30 a.m. traffic, not 8:00 a.m. traffic.

                    </li>
                    <li>Dissolve&mdash;All drive-time areas are merged into one, and  no more than one area can cover a particular location. This is useful when all you need to know is that an area can be reached within a given time or distance, but you don't need to know which specific input points can reach the location.
                    </li>
                    <li>Split&mdash;The drive-time areas from different input locations that would overlap each other are split in the middle, so they about one another instead. This is useful when you want to see which areas are within a given time or distance of the input points and, at the same time, determine which input point is closest to that area.
